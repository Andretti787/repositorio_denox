VC2015-2019 (VC16) is backward compatible to VC2015 (VC14) and VC2017 (VC15). That means, a VC14 or VC15 module can be used inside a VC16 binary. Because this compatibility the version number of the Redistributable is 14.2x.xx and after you install the Redistributable VC2015-2019, the Redistributable packages VC2015 (VC14) and VC2017 (VC15) are eventually deleted but you can still use VC14 and VC15.

If you have a 64-bit Windows, you must install both 32 and 64bit versions of each VisualC++ package, even if you do not use Wampserver 64 bit.
Warning: Sometimes Microsoft may update the VC ++ package by breaking the download links and without redirect to the new. If the case happens to you, remember that item number 20 below will be updated and the page http://wampserver.aviatechno.net/ section Visual C++ Redistribuable Packages is up to date.
This is item number 20 of TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS of Wampserver:

- Verify that all VC ++ packages are installed and with the latest versions.
To do this, use the tool: Checks VC++ packages installed
http://wampserver.aviatechno.net/files/tools/check_vcredist.exe
Do not use a previously loaded tool. Make a new download to make sure you are using the correct version.
To download missing packages, do not rely on Microsoft links, they are not reliable, download packages on http://wampserver.aviatechno.net/ in section Visual C++ Redistribuable Packages
Do not forget that if you have a 64 bit Windows, you must install both 32 and 64 bit versions of each package.
